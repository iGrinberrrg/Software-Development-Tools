Used Car Sales Data Analysis Tool
This project is a tool for analyzing and visualizing data from a spreadsheet containing information about used cars for sale. The application allows users to explore various attributes of the cars, such as their condition, model year, number of cylinders, and more. The tool uses interactive visualizations to help users better understand trends and distributions in the dataset.

Description:
This project provides an interactive web-based tool to analyze a dataset of used cars for sale. Users can filter the data by car condition and view different types of plots (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to explore trends in the data, such as the distribution of car model years, the number of cylinders, and how these factors relate to the car's condition.

Features:
- Filter cars based on their condition (e.g., new, like new, excellent, good, fair, salvage).
- Visualize data distributions using histograms and scatter plots.
- Interactive controls to modify the behavior of the visualizations.
- The tool is built using Streamlit for the front-end, Plotly Express for creating interactive plots, and Pandas for data manipulation.

Technologies and Libraries Used:
- Python: Programming language used for the backend.
- Streamlit: Framework used to create the web-based interface.
- Plotly Express: Used to create interactive plots such as histograms and scatter plots.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and filtering based on user input.
